# Falcon-40B_Text_Generation_with_Gradio_Interface
This project demonstrates the use of the powerful Falcon-40B large language model for text generation, wrapped in a clean and shareable Gradio interface. Falcon-40B is a state-of-the-art open-source LLM developed by TII, designed for scalable and high-quality text generation tasks.

Features:

Falcon-40B Integration for high-quality language generation.

Gradio App to make the model accessible via a simple and elegant web interface.

Multi-user Support via public Gradio share links.

Supports custom prompts, adjustable generation settings (max tokens, temperature, top_p).

Easily extensible to add fine-tuned Falcon models or prompt engineering tools.
